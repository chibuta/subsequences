Finding occurrences of a pattern **P** in a target string **D** using Dynamic Programming

Given a query string **P** and a target string **D**, the goal is find how many times **P** appears as a sub-sequence of **D**. Note that the term sub-sequence is not the same as the term sub-string and a sub-sequence may have other characters of **D** occuring in between the characters of **P**. For example, **AT** is a sub-sequence of **ACGT**. **CT** is also a sub-sequence of **ACGT**. However, **TA** is not a subsequence of **ACGT**. 

Formally, the problem can be stated as follows:
```
Given two strings **P** and **D**, how many different sequences of increasing indices, ind, you can find, so that D[ind1] + D[ind2] + D[ind3] +â€¦.+ D[ind|P|] = P. Here, ind is an array of increasing integers, + is the character concatenation operation, D[i] is the ith character of string D, and |P| is the length of the string P.
```
For example, if P is AT and D is AGTATCCTGTA, P occurs as a subsequence of D seven times, where the indices are [1,3], [1,5], [1,8], [1,10], [4,5], [4,8], and [4,10].
